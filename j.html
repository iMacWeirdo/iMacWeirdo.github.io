            I am truly sorry for what I did. My intentions were not to win you over, initially. I just naturally assumed that you didn't like me, so I made a 
            horrible move and told Elliot that you like him. This was completely the wrong move, because by doing so, I medled in both of your personal lives, 
            and I 100% should not have.
