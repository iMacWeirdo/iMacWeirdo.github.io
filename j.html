        <p>
            I am truly sorry for what I did. My intentions were not to win you over, initially. I just naturally assumed that you didn't like me, so I made a 
            horrible move and told Elliot that you like him. This was completely the wrong move, because by doing so, I medled in both of your personal lives, 
            and I 100% should not have.
        </p>

        <p>
            On another note, I really do feel awful for how I didn't tell you, but I know that that kind of stuff creates rifts in friendships and I didn't want 
            a repeat of what happened with you and Triston not talking for almost 4 months. In my mind (right now anyway), I make a better asshole than anything, so it's easier for me to just burn 
            the bridge before I even get to it. That's why I sent you what I did. I really hope that someday you'll be able to forgive me, but in the meantime, I 
            need to be distanced from the group so I don't do anything else stupid.
        </p>
